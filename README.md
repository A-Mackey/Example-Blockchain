# Example-Blockchain
This is a c++ coded example blockchain for educational and demonstrational purposes. After reading and looking into how the whole system works for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Etherium, I wanted to attempt to create a very small-scale example of my understanding.

## To Run
To run this program, you can simply execute the ./a.exe file in your command prompt. alternatively, you can compile the project yourself in any c++ compiler. If you have any problems, feel free to report an issue.

## Example Output
If all is up and running, an example output from this program will be
